## Task

**Track I: Secure multi-label Tumor classification using Homomorphic Encryption**

## Description

The goal of this track is to develop homomorphic encryption (HE) based multi-label classification method for predicting the classes of tumor samples based on genetic information.

This is a secure outsourcing scenario. We expect the model to be trained in plaintext using the challenge dataset. The trained plain model will be used for evaluation on reserved homomorphically encrypted data (assuming it can be hosted on untrusted servers) for performance measurement.



## Overview

- Model: logistic regression
- Homomorphic encrytion: CKKS
- Mentor: Xiang Xie
- Collaborator: Zhaomin Yang
- Result: achieved **93%** accuracy within **1 min**
