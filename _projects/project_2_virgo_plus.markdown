## Description

This is the implementation of [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1247), which build a GKR-based ZKP for unlayered circuit. We test our protocol with SHA circuits. Since the ZK property is derived from a zero-knowledge polynomial commitment, we support [Virgo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1482).
