I accepted the PhD offer from **Texas A&M university** advised by **Yupeng Zhang** and **Juan Garay**. Now I am in my gap year as an intern in **Shanghai Key Laboratory of Privacy-Preserving Computation**. Previously, I attained my bachelor degree in 2020 from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, one of the top universities in China.

My research interests lie broadly in **cryptography and security**, especially homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof system and their applications in machine learning.
